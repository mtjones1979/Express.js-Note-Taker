  ## Installation
  This application required the following NPM modules: fs, Express, and Path

  ## Test
  There are input boxes for both a note title and note text and a save button that pops up in the upper right hand corner of the page once text has been entered. Once a new note is saved it will then show up by title on the left hand side of the page. There will be a trash can delete button next to eah note so that you can delete them. If you click on the note title itself, it will pull that note title and text up to the center of the screen.
  The application is ran through Heroku.
